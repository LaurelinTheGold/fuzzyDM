# Specify k or give value from 0 to 12 representing the nth wavenumber on file


# do for both fiducial and fisher 

# 	NB: can be done in parallel

# 	first must scan all z to get specific PS(k) vs z values
# 	interpolate PS(k) vs z

# 	get xH vs z
# 	interpolate xH vs z

# 	numpy array of xH ranging from 0 to 1 
# 	numpy array of PS(k) where for each xH, match to redshift and then to PS(k)
